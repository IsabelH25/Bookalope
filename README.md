## What is Bookalope?

[Bookalope](https://bookalope.net/)
is a web service for document analysis, smart content and structure extraction for
[XML Workflow Publishing](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_workflow.html),
content checking, and conversion for electronic and print publication (EPUB2+3, MOBI,
PDF) as well as conversion for ongoing editing and design (ICML, DOCX).

The Bookalope services can be used interactively through the website or through
a REST API. Please visit our
[Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCxR_k6G06qEAj3IjZ9AcoQ)
to learn more about how the website works.

## The REST API

Increasingly Bookalope exposes its tools through a REST API that is documented
[here](https://bookalope.net/docs/api/Bookalope%20API.md). The example scripts
in the `clients/one-done-examples` folder illustrate the use of the API directly
from a shell or using the Python wrapper.
